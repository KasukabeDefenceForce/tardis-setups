# TARDIS Setups

This repository is intended to store all the different setups used in the papers. Published papers that use the TARDIS code are required to put their setups and the resulting spectra in this repository. The setups and spectra are licensed under CCA 4.0 - that means you can use and change the setups as long as you attribute the original paper of the setup used (linked to in each folder).

This repository can also be used to store any other setups. We're fine if they link to a Zenodo entry so that they are citeable.
